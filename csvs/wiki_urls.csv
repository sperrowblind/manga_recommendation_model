The Story

When he was a child, Naruto was isolated from its community. The people in the village treated him as he was Nine-Tails itself and don't want him. None in the village had the right to mention the Nine-Tails, in order to prevent Naruto from finding the truth. But 12 years later, he finds out the truth from ninja Mizuki, who told him. Some time later, Naruto becomes a ninja and usually competes against other teams, and they form a three-person team by the name Team 7. Like all the other similar teams in every village, the Team 7 has to complete missions that are requested by the villagers, ranging from being bodyguards or doing chores. After participating in a number of missions, the Team 7 is allowed to take place in an exam, in order to move up in hierarchy and be able to be involved in more difficult missions. After 2,5 years, Naruto returns from training and he continued with his team to fight the Akatsuki members.

Production

When Kishimoto first made the plot of the story, thought that it was a mess. For example, he thought that the chakras, along with other hand signs made Naruto look like a lot of Japanese them, but he believed that it could be enjoyable for reading. In these particular series, he actually tried to make his characters to look like unique ones. Above all he based his main theme on the Japanese culture and he separated the characters in the series into different teams, in order to give to each team a special flavor. He wanted to make each member to look like an 'extreme' character and when he was creating them, Kishimoto followed the 5 steps, like drafting, sketching, colouring, inking and shading. Moreover, when he started creating the series, Kishimoto paid attention to the designs of the village and the settings. For instance, the village was created spontaneously, but he took the idea for the scenery from his home in Okayama, in Japan.
