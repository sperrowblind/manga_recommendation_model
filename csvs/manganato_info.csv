Berserk Manga is a Japanese dark fantasy manga series illustrated and written by Kentaro Miura. Place in a medieval Europe-divine the narrative centers on the characters of Guts dark fantasy world, a lone mercenary, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary group known as the Band of the Hawk.

Both anime and the manga are noticed for their utilization of sexual content and heavy violence.
 Guts in Berserk manga
The Hawks play a critical role in stopping the 100-year war which has ravaged the state of Midland and are initially welcomed as heroes, when Guts leaves the Hawks to seek out his own vision, but Griffith's aspirations to rule his own kingdom are shattered. Not able to deal together with the loss, Griffith leads to the dungeon to get a year and seduces the King's daughter Charlotte. From the time Guts helps the outlawed remnants of the Hawks and learns of this save him, Griffith left and has been terribly mutilated a mute shadow of his former self. Of understanding his body, the weight is too damaged for him to execute he inadvertently activates the behelit on his man and his wishes shows too much for Griffith. This brings the Hawks to a different airplane in the place where they fall upon archdemons known as the four God Hand in the service called the Eclipse. Urged on from the eldritch beings, Griffith gives his soldiers to the apostles--people like Zodd who lost mankind and their nearest and dearest for power of the God Hand --so he is able to end up being the closing member of the God Hand. Though he along with his lover Casca are saved from certain death by the mysterious Skull Knight labeled, Guts witnesses the savage slaughter of his comrades. Intestines loses an eye and an arm while Casca is driven mad after being raped by the reborn Griffith, now called Femto.
 
Miura premiered a model of Berserk Manga in 1988.
 
There, falling upon Farnese of the Holy Iron Chain Knights of the Holy See Church , Guts finds himself going through a nightmarish ordeal that finishes in the physical type restored of Griffith. Griffith creates another Band of the Hawk with Zodd as well as other Apostles among its ranks to fight the invading Kushan military as Guts takes Casca to the Elven kingdom of Elfhelm for safety together with the aid of his new comrades. The war between the Kushan emperor and Griffith, a rogue apostle, culminates using the emperor's destruction as well as the overlapping of the supernatural as well as the mortal world. No longer challenged by guy or devil, Griffith creates his rule using the sanction of the Pope and Princess Charlotte over Midland, creating the city of Falconia to give you safety to the Midlanders in the ever-increasing assaults of creatures that are fabulous

The Best Attack On Titan Manga Review
Attack on Titan Manga is a series created by Hajime Isayama. The series is based on a fictional story of humanity’s last stand against man-eating giant creatures known as Titans. The series commenced in 2009 and has been going on for 6 years now. Attack on Titans manga is expected to continue with the success, and even get better with time. According to the series’ editor Kuwakubo Shintaro, there are approximately 3 years’ worth of chapters yet to be published for the extensively popular manga.

Characters in Attack on Titan Manga
 
Set in an alternative universe about a century ago, when the grotesque giants known as titans attacked and consumed all but a few thousand humans. The 3-15 meters tall giants looked extremely similar to humans, and when they appeared, they almost drove humanity into extinction. The few lucky survivors took refuge and hid behind giant walls. They built the 3 set of high, solid walls around their capital to keep the Titans off and save them from these monsters.
 
For over a hundred years after the survivors built the walls and hid from Titans, peace had prevailed, and humanity enjoyed the sweetness of freedom and safety. They forgot all the bad memories of the gory past. After one hundred and two years of peace and joy, suddenly a sixty-meter-tall titan attacked the outermost wall. What could have been humanity’s worst nightmare had suddenly come to life, and the pain and fear of perishing began to reign in their minds. Other titans entered the part of the city between the first two walls, then killed and ate people living there. 

Eren Jaeger, a ten-year-old boy who had witnessed his own mother perish in the hands of the titans, vowed to avenge his mother’s death against the titans and wipe the giant creatures out completely. The boy joined Training Corps, which trained people who were ready to join the war against titans, and five years later he fights his first battle against the titans.

The narrative of Attack on Titan Manga revolves around the experiences of his foster sister, Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, Armin Arlert, as well as their childhood friend. Following the wall which protects Titans breach their hometown of Shinganshina, Eren sees in horror as his mom is eaten by among them.

Five years after, the three cadet graduates are placed in Trost District, one among the border towns when the Titans assault again jutting out of Wall Rose. In the ensuing conflict, among the Titans eats Eren before the eyes of Armin. A Titan after appears and starts fighting with the other Titans while blowing off people; the Titan is disclosed to be Eren, that has acquired the capability to transform into one. After being put on trial for being a risk to the people, he's taken in from the Survey Corps' Special Operations Squad, headed by Captain Levi.

In a expedition to Shinganshina, a Female Titan who tries to get Eren attacks the Scouts. Even though the Scouts really are able to briefly get the Female Titan, free and devastates Levi's squad breaks, driving the expedition to pull away. Armin decides the Female Titan is among the cadets who instructed Eren to fight, Annie, and formulates a strategy to get her at Stohess. In this operation, collateral damage shows that Titans make up the walls enclosing the human settlements and reside in.

Some of Eren's pals will also be disclosed in order to transform into Titans and was sent as spies by an unidentified party to locate something called ""The Coordinate"". It's after verified that the Coordinate is the capacity to command other Titans at will, and that that power is held by Eren. The Military Police as well as the royal family track his buddy Krista Lenz and Eren, who's really Historia Reiss, the successor to the king that is true, Rod Reiss, as the present king is but a figurehead.

Eren also gets a fresh power that enables him to create long-lasting and substantial constructions the Survey Corps mean to make use of so that you can seal the breach in Shinganshina and retrieve Wall Maria

Show is set on a fictional medieval island where people are harassed by Yoma, humanoid shape-shifters that feed on people. A cryptic group, called The Organization, creates human-Yoma hybrid vehicles to kill Yoma for a fee. These female warriors wear uniforms that are armored.


Main character in Claymore manga

Claymore and Yoma warriors likewise are powered with a demonic energy, Yoki, allowing shape-shifting extreme strength and. The action of awakening is likened to the sensation of sexual climax while both female and male warriors existed in days gone by hence the development of male Claymores ceased completely and only the girls proved to be successful warriors.

The isle world is divided with one warrior delegated to each. Claymore warriors No. 1 through 47 are rated on their service line Yoki possible, strength, agility, wisdom, feeling and leadership. A warrior's status falls and climbs based on the warrior's strength in terms of other warriors. It's not clear when the possibility lies within the warriors or whether the warriors strength comes from training/expertise.

Along with all having distinct names, most warriors (typically full of status) further their identity by possessing an original sword technique, fighting style, or yoki power. A couple of fighting styles include: releasing a blast of yoki to get a brief fit of speed, fighting with two swords, and extending the arm. For yoki skill, there are quite precisely in close quarters and many Claymores who are able to feel yoki over vast spaces. This seems to be, while not attacking, a precious and very uncommon skill as well as the Claymores in the Organization with this skill are generally highly rated.

The first is Galatea's power to command her adversaries yoki for short intervals during conflict, generally to cause the assault to lose of the enemy. The 2nd is Teresa's: her power to feel yoki is not really weak that she is able to feel her adversaries body being moved around by it how and when her enemy would attack next, and will thus feel, a technique afterwards reproduced by Clare. The next skill is the fact that of Raftela who's in a position to control movements and the eyesight of other Claymores. She's used as an anti-warrior warrior.

Claymores would be the titular characters of the show.
People would be the most numerous and politically dominant species understood in both the Mainland as well as the Island.



Yoma are beings that feed on blood and human flesh. They are able to shapeshift into human form which allows them to dwell among people. They are created by the Organization by sending them to the North while the daughters are sent to the East to become Claymores and rounding up orphan sons. The outcome is a Yoma.
